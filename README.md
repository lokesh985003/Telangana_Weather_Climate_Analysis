## 🚀 Features / Highlights  

### 💼 **Business Problem**  
Telangana experiences diverse weather patterns that significantly impact agriculture, health, transport, and energy.  
Stakeholders often lack a unified platform to visualize and compare district-level weather dynamics for effective planning and disaster risk management.  

### 🎯 **Goal of the Dashboard**  
To develop an **interactive Power BI solution** that helps:  
- Analyze rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind-speed variations across Telangana districts  
- Identify seasonal and long-term climate trends  
- Detect extreme events (droughts, floods, heatwaves)  
- Support policymakers and environmental analysts with actionable insights

### 💡 **Business Impact & Insights**  
- 🌧 **70% of Telangana’s rainfall** occurs during monsoon (June–September) — strong seasonal dependency.  
- 🌡 **Rising yearly temperature trend** suggests gradual climate warming.  
- 💧 **Humidity highly correlated** with rainfall intensity — critical for forecasting.  
- 🌬 **Coastal & northern districts** face more wind-speed anomalies, vital for infrastructure planning.  
- 🧠 Enables policymakers to **plan irrigation, crop selection, and disaster readiness** using real-time insights.
